**11ty.Recipes is the site I wish existed when I first started making Eleventy sites.** I spent hours upon hours trying to reverse-engineer a bunch of Eleventy starter kits trying to figure out how to add specific features to my sites. I did a lot of Googling. I bugged [Zach](https://twitter.com/zachleat) incessantly. I spamed the [Eleventy Discord](https://discord.gg/GBkBy9u). My hope is that through my failures you'll be able to build the exact site you want with the recipes found here. Not every recipe is specific to Eleventy, but I think you'll find them useful nonetheless. 

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is Eleventy?

The [Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) sum it up nicely:

> Eleventy was created to be a JavaScript alternative to Jekyll. It’s zero-config by default but has flexible configuration options. Eleventy works with your project’s existing directory structure.
